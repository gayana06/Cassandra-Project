Remove openjdk
sudo apt-get purge openjdk*

Open iptable ports
ptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7000 -j ACCEPT

Give permission to a folder
sudo chown -R chathuri /var/log/cassandra

Install JDK 7
> cd /usr/local
> tar xzf <the file you just downloaded>
As your normal user, add or change these two lines in your ~/.profile to point to the installation;

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.7.0_13
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
If it's an update, you may also want to remove the old java installation directory in /usr/local.

Log out and in again (or do . ~/.profile), and everything should just work.

Disable overlay scroll bar

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface ubuntu-overlay-scrollbars false
